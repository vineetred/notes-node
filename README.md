# notes-node
Just a simple notes app written using Node.JS

The input to this app is done through the node terminal/command prompt. Arguements are passed through the same method. I used Yargs and lodash to take care of the input parsing as to avoid writing length code that does the same work.

To install the modules that you might not have, run 
```
npm install
```
and you are good to go!
